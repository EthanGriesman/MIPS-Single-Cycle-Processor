# Single-Cycle CPU Project

Project involving the construction from scratch of a central processing unit using VHDL and assembly. After a general, single cycle processor was constructed in Part 1, Part 2 involved the pipelining and optimization of the CPU into both a hardware and software pipeline for the CPU. Lastly, for the final part, the clock rate performance of the pipelined processor was measured against the original CPU to observe improvements.
